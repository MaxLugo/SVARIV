# SVARIV in python 

# In construction

(This repository is python implementation of the original repository in matlab)

This repository contains a python suite to construct weak-instrument robust confidence intervals for impulse response coefficients in Structural Vector Autoregressions identified with an external instrument. See "Inference in Structural Vector Autoregressions identified by an external instrument" by J.L Montiel Olea, J. H. Stock, and M. W. Watsoâ€¦

The original repository is the following: https://github.com/jm4474/SVARIV

The original paper can be download from: http://www.joseluismontielolea.com/papers.html 


Folder:

data = required data from the paper. 

Files:

SVARIV.py
Contains the related functions for the implementation. The What, wald test, Gamma_hat, irf procedures and plot functions are inside the file.

example.py
This file will call SVARIV.py functions and replicates the results. file format .py (native python)

example.ipynb
This file will call SVARIV.py functions and replicates the results. file format .ipynb (jupyter)

Both files example.* have the same in the content.

requirements.txt
Libraries required to run the the python implementation

runtime.txt
Python version to be use (in this case was tested in python-3.7.6)
But it should run in python 3+

At the moment the confidence intervals are constructed with a simple bootstrap procedure which are not the intervals presented
in the paper. 

# Jobs to be done

1. Correction on the intervals CS_boots so the CS_boots=CS_AR in this repo. 
2. Create the intervals CS_plugin of the methodology in the paper.
